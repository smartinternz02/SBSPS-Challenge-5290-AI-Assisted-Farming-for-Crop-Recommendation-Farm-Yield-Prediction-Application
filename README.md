# SBSPS-Challenge-5290-AI-Assisted-Farming-for-Crop-Recommendation-Farm-Yield-Prediction-Application
We have created an AI Assisted farming modeller which helps us to predict the crop according to soil feasibility,PHofSoil and temperature.It helps us alot to predict the crop which gives us a good yield.
We have created a modeller using watson studio.<br><ol><li>CROPPREDICT.JAVA denotes the building code of our prediction model.<br></li><li>flows.json denotes the inputs in json format that helps us to predict the crop which yields the best.</li>
<li>simulator.json file denotes that the values are automatically generated with a random value by an IOT simulator.</li></ol>
